This folder will contain all the coding/challenges I'm doing for the PiHut Raspberry Pi advent calendar. 

I originally started this as a continuation from the "Google Cybersecurity" course as a fun follow up to do over the holiday period to get more familiar with Python in a playful (festive) way.
