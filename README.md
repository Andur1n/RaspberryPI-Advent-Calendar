# 🎄 Raspberry Pi – Advent Calendar Project

A festive, hands-on coding project using **Python** and a **Raspberry Pi**, inspired by a daily Advent calendar format.

Each day focuses on a small challenge, script, or experiment related to:
- Python programming
- Hardware interaction (GPIO)
- Linux fundamentals
- Automation & scripting
- Creative problem solving

---

## 🔧 Tech Used

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Micropython
- GPIO / hardware projects
- Thonny
- GitHub

---

⚠️ Please note most of the coding comes directly from Raspberry Huts page for the advent calendar. Coding here has been slightly amended for learning/play purposes as I wanted all code in 1 place for future use.
